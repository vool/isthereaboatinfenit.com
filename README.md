[IsThereABoatInFenit.com](http://isthereaboatinfenit.com) is simple webpage which aims to answer the enduring question, is there a boat in fenit ?

[Fenit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenit) is the only deep sea port in County Kerry, Ireland, and has one deep sea berth, so there is no messing about here, the answer is **yes** or **no**.

It is the most westerly commercial port in Europe, and the birthplace of the [fella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan) who discovered the Americas.
